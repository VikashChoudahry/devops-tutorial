# About

This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node. This is just to understand the flow of build process through Jenkins.

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.

## How it works

1. Make any changes to the code base.
2. Add the changes file.
3. On commit build should start automatically and publish it to docker hub repo.
